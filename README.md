# My first repository

Welcome to my GitHub repo! :smile:

Here I will *commit*, _pull_ and *push* plaintext documents and `code` online or from RStudio.

Here is a picture of a chick. It is by [Philipp Kleindienst](https://pixabay.com/en/chicks-spring-chicken-plumage-349035/).

## Another new section created on GitHub

I will need to **pull** this!
